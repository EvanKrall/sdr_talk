# What is Software Defined Radio?

- A software radio peripheral (SRP), usually just called an SDR, samples radio waves around a certain frequency, digitizes, sends to a computer.
   - will talk about how these devices work in a bit.
- Then we can use software to decode the sampled radio waves.
- On some hardware we can do the reverse, generating signals in software and transmitting them.

## RTL-SDR dongles

There are lots of RTL-SDR dongles. Get one with a TCXO.

# Why?

Same reason we use software for other things: software is more flexible than hardware.

Military, telecommunications infrastructure use SDR for reconfigurability.

For hobbyists, flexibility == hackability.

# Some cool things you can do with RTL-SDRs

---

## Listen to things!

- Broadcast FM, AM, etc.
- AIS: ships
- ADS-B: planes
- Weather satellites
- Police/Fire radio (not the encrypted stuff.)
- POCSAG (Pagers).

???

Demos:

- GQRX:
   - Broadcast FM: 104.5 MHz
   - POCSAG: 152.840 MHz
- ADS-B
   - `dump1090 --interactive --net`
- AIS
   - `rtl_ais -n`
   - `OpenCPN`

---

## "Security research"

- Tire Pressure Monitoring System
   - track cars driving by you &amp; see their tire pressure.
- Smart meters
- Wireless surveillance cameras / baby monitors
- [Use rainbow tables to crack GSM encryption, intercept SMSes](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/hacking-gsm-signals-with-an-rtl-sdr-and-topguw/)
- [Extracting GPG keys from nearby computers](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/stealing-encryption-keys-from-pcs-using-software-defined-radio-and-unintentional-electromagnetic-emissions/)

# Some things you can do if you have fancier hardware

---

## Reboot a space probe

NASA, with the help of some "citizen scientists" (SDR experts), attempted to establish contact with space probe ISEE-3 17 years after it had been deactivated.
Within 2 months, they had established contact and started getting telemetry.

---

## Run a cell phone tower

You can run a GSM tower if you have a radio with >56MHz of bandwidth and simultaneous transmit/receive capability (e.g. USRP B200).
This can be used to MITM phone calls, SMSes, data.

.center[<iframe width="640" height="320" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKihq1fClQg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>]

---

## Super-easy replay attacks

With a transmit-capable SRP, you can simply capture radio samples.
Some low-security devices are susceptible to replay attacks:

 - Fixed code garage doors
 - RC power outlets

---

## Spy on people using sat phones

Iridium phones use a constellation of satellites, each of which serves a fairly wide region.
The protocol is also fairly insecure.
Some phone calls are encrypted, but some are not.

## Legality (reception)

**I am not a lawyer.**

A not-at-all comprehensive list of things that can get you into trouble:

- Decrypting encrypted transmissions
- Publishing intercepted transmissions
- Profiting from / using the information for commercial gain
- Using what you hear for the purposes of other crimes

---

## Legality (reception)

Some things that are okay:

- Anything intended for the general public.
- Amateur radio / CB / GMRS
- Marine or aeronautical communication systems

If you can legally buy a device that receives it, it's probably okay to receive.

---

## Legality (transmission)

Generally speaking, **transmitting with an SDR is illegal**, unless you have a license for that frequency.

This even applies to "license-free" bands like ISM, CB, MURS, FRS
&mdash; on these bands, devices themselves are licensed (certified), and your SDR transmitter is not.

---

## Legality (transmission)

The easiest license to get is an Amateur Radio license
&mdash; a few dollars and a test, and you get a bunch of different frequencies.

Amateur bands overlap many common ISM bands, including 433 MHz, 915 MHz, 2.4 GHz.

# What do the samples coming from SDR hardware look like?

Like squiggly and/or fuzzy lines.

.fullwidth[ ![FM signal on time domain](./fm_waves_time_domain.png) ]

---

## Why are there two lines from one antenna?

.float-right[![Constellation plot of FM radio signal](./fm_waves_constellation.png)]

SDR hardware gives us "in-phase" and "quadrature" components of the signal, or "I" and "Q".
We treat these as complex numbers, which gives us some notational advantages:


 - Negative frequencies
 - Shift frequencies by multiplying by a complex exponential.
 - Per-sample amplitude
 - Inter-sample frequency


---

# Frequency domain

We can also send samples through Fast Fourier Transform and plot the output.
This tells us how much energy exists at different frequencies.

.fullwidth[![FM signal on frequency domain](./fm_waves_freq_domain.png)]

---

## Waterfall charts

Same math as before (FFT), but shows frequency content over time

.fullwidth[![FM signal on frequency domain](./fm_waves_waterfall.png)]

(sorry, colorblind folks)

# GNU Radio

[Originally started to demonstrate to the FCC how futile it is to have a "broadcast flag" in ATSC.](http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view;jsessionid=0Kf2SPvH5VyLmfGmnnLfVhDdYG7Bn5GrQQ2RpynjpS1phMgl7zYp!1357496456!-1864380355?id=6513395349)

Installable via homebrew/macports, most Linux package managers.
Windows users should get the [PothosSDR bundle](https://github.com/pothosware/PothosSDR/wiki/Tutorial#download-and-install)

Python glue, C++ signal processing.

Can be scripted in python, or you can use `gnuradio-companion` to point-and-click boxes.

# Let's build a software-defined FM radio!

???

- open GRC
- new flow graph
- Set `samp_rate` to `2e6`
- add osmocom source
  - Set frequency to 107.7e6
  - enable AGC
- Add waterfall chart for visibility.
- Run flowgraph.
- Add Quadrature Demod -> QT GUI Time Sink
   - Fix errors:
      - create variable `fsk_deviation_hz`
      - Change input type of time sink to float
- Run flowgraph
- Enable autoscaling on time sink, run flowgraph again.
- Add audio sink with sample rate `int(samp_rate)`.
   - Unmute
   - Kinda sounds right, but also sounds really bad.
   - Add low pass filter, cutoff 100e3 / transition 25e3, run again, should sound better.
- Set decimation:
   - Add variable `decimation`, value 10
   - Add variable down_rate, value `samp_rate / decimation`
   - Set decimation of low pass filter
   - adjust bandwidth, etc. of everything downstream of LPF
- Why is frequency sink symmetric?
   - Quadrature demod gives us a real number.
