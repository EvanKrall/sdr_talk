# Agenda

1. What is SDR?
1. Some quick demos
1. Radio basics
1. How does SDR work?
1. How to get started with SDR

# What is Software Defined Radio?

- A software radio peripheral (SRP), sometimes called a "software defined radio", samples radio waves around a certain frequency, digitizes, sends to a computer.
  - will talk about how these devices work in a bit.
- Then use software to decode the sampled radio waves.
- There are very cheap ($10-$30) SRPs called RTL-SDR
- Can also do this in reverse: use software to generate a digital signal, send to SRP, SRP transmits.

---

# Why?

Same reason we use software for other things: software is more flexible than hardware.

Military, telecommunications infrastructure use SDR for reconfigurability.

## Some cool things you can do with RTL-SDR devices

---

## Listen to things!

- Broadcast FM, AM, etc.
- AIS: ships
- ADS-B: planes
- Weather satellites
- Police/Fire radio (not the encrypted stuff.)
- POCSAG (Pagers).

???

Demos:

- GQRX:
  - Broadcast FM: ??
  - Broadcast TV: ??
  - POCSAG: ??
- ADS-B
  - `dump1090 --interactive --net`
- AIS
  - `rtl_ais -n`
  - `OpenCPN`

---

## "Security research"

- Tire Pressure Monitoring System
- Smart meters
- Wireless surveillance cameras / baby monitors
- "Internet of Things"
- Use rainbow tables to crack GSM encryption, intercept SMSes
- Unintended radiation
  - Video cables emit RF which can be captured
  - Extracting GPG keys from nearby computers

---

## Legality (reception)

**I am not a lawyer.**

A not-at-all comprehensive list of things that can get you into trouble:

- Decrypting encrypted transmissions
- Publishing intercepted transmissions
- Profiting from / using the information for commercial gain
- Using what you hear for the purposes of other crimes

Some things that are okay:

- Anything intended for the general public.
- Amateur radio / CB / GMRS
- Marine or aeronautical communication systems

---

## Legality (transmission)

**I am not a lawyer.**

Generally speaking, **transmitting with an SDR is illegal**, unless you have a license for that frequency.

This even applies to "license-free" bands like ISM, CB, MURS, FRS
&mdash; on these bands, the devices themselves are licensed (certified), and your SDR transmitter is not.

The easiest license to get is an Amateur Radio license
&mdash; a few dollars and a test, and you get a bunch of different frequencies.

Amateur bands overlap many common ISM bands.

- Radio basics
   - electromagnetic waves
   - define terms:
      - amplitude
      - frequency
      - phase
  - basic modulations:
    - Analog modulations (continuous values)
      - frequency modulation
      - amplitude modulation
  - Relationship between trigonometric and complex exponential
  - Fourier transform
    - Define: takes infinitely repeating, continuous time signal, breaks it down into frequency components
    - Examples: sine wave, square wave, triangle wave
      - demonstrate how square wave can be constructed of many sine waves
    - Reversible: inverse fourier transform
    - DFT: FT can be done in discrete time, on time-limited sections
      - spectrum analyzers (image: periodogram)
      - waterfall chart / spectrogram (image: spectrogram, inspectrum, baudline)

---

  - Let's look at our modulations in the frequency domain
    - FM
      - oh hey it's a wavy line
      - kinda looks like our audio.
      - pretty much what you'd expect.
      - let's zoom out (take longer FFTs) and explore relationship of audio bandwidth to radio bandwidth
    - AM
      - show spectrogram of AM signal
      - what's going on with those side bands?
        - show math that explains those, using complex exponentials (TODO: math)

<!--
    - SSB: a modification of AM
      - In AM, the carrier contains no/little information
      - Also, the upper and lower side bands
      - we're wasting >half of our power on redundant frequencies
      - Let's just go ahead and cut these out using a high pass filter.
-->
  - Heterodyne / frequency shifting
    - Multiplying two signals produces side bands at the sum and difference of the two frequencies
    - What if we took an RF signal (from an antenna, perhaps), amplitude modulated it with some nearby frequency?
    - We'd end up with the original signal, frequency shifted down.
    - If you shift all the way down to zero, you can demodulate SSB
    - However, there's a problem: any signal just below your local oscillator frequency also gets shifted down.
    - The problem is that we can't distinguish negative frequencies from positive frequencies. How do we do that?

# Software Radio Peripheral internals

- Tuner (Local oscillator, mixer)
- ADC

## What do the samples look like?

---

# Let's do some SDR already!

---

# GNU Radio
